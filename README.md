# Fifth Element

Web Implementation of D&D 5th Edition.


## Development


### Makefile

All common development tasks are written down as Make targets in _Makefile_.

You need to have a recent version of [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed
and on your path. (I'm on version 6.14.4.) Other than Npm (and Make), no other
configuration or setup _should_ be required. If a Make target doesn't work out
of the box after cloning the project, then it's a bug! Please
[let me know](mailto:danielbrice@gmail.com).


### Dependencies

To add a Purescript dependency, for example _effect_, use
`npx spago install effect`.

To add a Javascript dependency, for example _left-pad_, use
`npm install left-pad`.
